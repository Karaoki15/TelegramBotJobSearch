## 🎯 What the Bot Does <a id="features"></a>

* **Clear flows without noise.**
  • Candidate: sign up (profile) → browse vacancies → "Apply/Skip" → next card.
  • Employer: create vacancy → receive and conveniently review applications.
* **Full‑featured profile & vacancy editor** (not a demo‑level form).
* **City‑first recommendations** on day one, so the feed is relevant immediately.
* **De‑spam applications.** If a vacancy gets multiple applications, the bot merges them into a queue and lets HR review them one by one.
* **Gentle reminders for users** (come back later) and **admin alerts** on reported profiles.
* **Anti‑spam:** if a candidate reacts too fast to cards, a short **5‑minute** cooldown is applied.
* **Content limits:** per user — **1 vacancy**; per vacancy — **1 photo** and up to **1024 characters** in the description.
* **Paid access for employers** (posting vacancies) via **Tribute**. The bot **checks daily** whether the employer still belongs to the required group/channel: if yes — access stays on; if not — access is revoked and the vacancy is hidden.
* **Privacy:** candidate contacts are revealed **only on a match** and **only to the employer**. Data is not shared with third parties and is stored on our server. No global export on demand.
* **Data normalization:** clickable links are stripped from descriptions.

## ✨ What Makes It Different <a id="diff"></a>

* **Production‑grade editors** for profiles and vacancies — not restricted demo forms.
* **Anti‑spam & quiet applications:** merging into a queue reduces noise and saves HR time.
* **Relevance out of the box:** city‑based recommendations for a useful initial feed.
* **Controlled monetization:** Tribute‑based access without tying into Telegram Payments; daily membership validation in a channel/group.
* **Retention without annoyance:** short motivational snippets between cards — light “breaks” that improve engagement.
* **Privacy by default:** contacts show up only on match and only to the employer.
* **Production readiness:** the project has been handed over and is ready for real‑world use; this repository showcases the architecture.

## 🧭 User Flows <a id="flows"></a>

**Candidate**

1. Creates a profile.
2. Swipes through vacancy cards.
3. Presses "Apply" or "Skip" — receives the next card.

**Employer**

1. Creates a vacancy.
2. Receives and reviews **merged** applications.

---

## 💬 Commands <a id="commands"></a>

* **/start** — full session reset and **FSM reset**.
* **/admin** — enter the admin panel (whitelist‑only access).

---

## 🔧 Admin & Moderation <a id="admin"></a>

* Create **stub vacancies** for launch (so new users see enough cards and don’t churn).
* Moderation: remove a profile or **block** a user.
* Search by **user ID** with a quick profile view.
* Generate **tracking links** (UTM‑like) to attribute traffic sources.
* **Motivational content** for candidates: shown between cards (short “breaks” in a TikTok‑like spirit to reduce fatigue and motivate further browsing).

---

## 📊 Analytics <a id="analytics"></a>

Deep analytics wasn’t required. Implemented basic tracking: counting visits from the special links generated by the bot.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy <a id="privacy"></a>

* No data is shared with third parties.
* Candidate contacts are visible to the employer **only after a match**.
* Data is stored on our server. Centralized user‑data export is not provided.

---

## 🧱 Architecture & Tech <a id="tech"></a>

* **Language/Framework:** Python 3.12.4, aiogram 3.3.0.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (administered via pgAdmin 4 if needed).
* **ORM/DB access:** SQLAlchemy.
* **Logging:** separate files for regular events and errors — convenient for incident analysis and regression tracking.
* **Interface:** standard Telegram messages and inline buttons; Telegram Web App is **not used**.
* **Monetization/Access:** Tribute integration with a daily membership check in the target group/channel.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality <a id="quality"></a>

* **Manual testing** throughout development: author, friends, and the employer.
* **Checklist of key flows:** onboarding and FSM reset; creating/editing profiles and vacancies; browsing cards; matching and contact reveal; limits (1 photo, 1024 chars); 5‑minute anti‑spam cooldown; moderation/blocks; Tribute subscription check; reports and admin notifications.
* **Edge cases and negative scenarios:** double button presses, stale `callback_data`, length limits for text/media, missing photos, empty required fields.
* **Reliability:** careful FSM reset on `/start` and predictable state under network timeouts.
* **Debugging via logs:** separate event/error files; anomaly detection by correlating records.

> Automated tests were not in scope for this project.

## 🚧 Limits & Behavior <a id="limits"></a>

* 1 photo and up to 1024 characters in a vacancy description.
* 1 active vacancy per user; no other hard limits.
* Under peak load the bot processes events sequentially; critical errors are logged.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap <a id="roadmap"></a>

* Multi‑language (RU/UA/EN, etc.).
* Extended analytics (funnels, apply/match conversion, button CTR).
* Smarter matching (skill weights, distance/relocation, work‑format preferences).
* Admin reports and exports (vacancies/applications/users).
